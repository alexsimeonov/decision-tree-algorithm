# Decision tree algorithm

#### This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's degree in Authomation, Information and Control systems thesis.

The implemented algorithm is for growing a decision tree. The initial dataset, along with configuration is set in the `data` folder. The application starts with running `dt_algorithm.py` file from `src`. Follow the instructions in the terminal and once the algorithm is running - wait for the results.

#### Requirements

1. Runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS.
2. Python v.3.6 or higher.
3. `Pip` in order to install the dependencies.
  * External libraries used:
    - aislab
    - pandas
    - treelib
